How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You should make sure that everyone else also benefits from your work, so you should include a copy of this license whenever you distribute a copy of your program.
